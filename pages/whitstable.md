Whitstable (/ˈhwɪtstəbəl/) is a seaside town on the north coast of Kent in southeastern England,[2] 5 miles (8 km) north of Canterbury and 2 miles (3 km) west of Herne Bay. It has a population of about 32,000.

Whitstable was famous for its 'Native Oysters' which were collected from beds beyond the low water mark from Roman times until the mid-20th century. The annual Whitstable Oyster Festival takes place during the summer.

In 1830, one of the earliest passenger railway services was opened[3] by the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway Company. In 1832 the company built a harbour and extended the line to handle coal and other bulk cargos for the City of Canterbury. The railway has closed but the harbour still plays an important role in the town's economy. The railway route, known as The Crab and Winkle Line, is now a cycle path which leads to the neighbouring city of Canterbury.
